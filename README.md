# Kali-Linux-2024

For this Information Security Practical project, I focused on utilizing Kali Linux to conduct a variety of penetration testing and security analysis tasks. I began by installing Kali Linux and familiarizing myself with its core functionalities. I used Metasploit to conduct penetration tests, tested the integrity of text files using hashdeep, and employed The Harvester for gathering information about potential targets. To ensure anonymity and enhance security, I utilized anonymous scanning websites and created a guest user account to test various configurations. I performed password cracking with Crunch and monitored Wi-Fi networks for vulnerabilities. Additionally, I ran various scripts and scanned devices and websites, including Google.com, to assess security. I also leveraged Metasploit for Windows searches and utilized Autopsy for forensic analysis, compiling screenshots and documentation of each activity to demonstrate my proficiency and findings.
